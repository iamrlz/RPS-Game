# Instructions for you :)

This is a simple Python implementation of the classic **Rock, Paper, Scissors** game.

## How to Play

1. Run the `main.py` file by navigating to its directory in your terminal and using the command:
    ```sh
    python main.py
    ```
2. Choose your move by entering one of the following options:
   - `1` for Rock
   - `2` for Paper
   - `3` for Scissors
   - Or, enter `0` to quit the game.
3. The computer will randomly choose its move as well.
4. The game follows these rules to determine the winner:
   - **Rock beats Scissors**
   - **Paper beats Rock**
   - **Scissors beats Paper**
   - If both players choose the same option, it's a tie.
5. After each round, the program will display:
   - Your choice
   - The computer's choice
   - The result of the game

Youâ€™ll then have the option to play again or quit.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x is required to run the game.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository or download the `main.py` file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your computer by running `python --version` or `python3 --version`.
3. Navigate to the folder containing `main.py`.
